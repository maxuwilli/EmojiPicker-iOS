This is my first super simple iOS app I built in an effort to start learning iOS development with Swift + Xcode.

---
# Use
EmojiPicker allows you to pick one of 4 emojis and will display the emoji in a large format in the view. The actual name of the emoji is also shown below.
# Future Directions
- [ ] Styling the app so it doesn't look so bland.
- [ ] Adding a full emoji picker so the user can choose from any of the default emojis on the device. This will allow them to see the corresponding name of every single emoji.
